# Nemo Actions & Cinnamon Scripts

A collection of custom context menu actions for the Nemo file manager, along with some miscellaneous feature scripts intended for the Cinnamon desktop environment.

## Nemo Actions

To install any particular action the `foo.nemo_action` file should be saved in `~./local/share/nemo/actions`
Some of the actions in this repo also have an associated shell script. In all cases that script should also be saved in `~./local/share/nemo/actions` and be made executable.
Two of the actions in this repo which allow users to open files owned by root with elevated privileges require a valid polkit policy to be installed in `/usr/share/polkit-1/actions`
These can be found [here](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/tree/master/nemo_actions/usr/share/polkit-1/actions)

[session_menu_logout.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/desktop_only_actions/session_menu_logout.nemo_action)
[session_menu_poweroff.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/desktop_only_actions/session_menu_poweroff.nemo_action)

These four actions immediately invoke the requested action.

[session_reboot.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/desktop_only_actions/session_reboot.nemo_action)
[session_shutdown.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/desktop_only_actions/session_shutdown.nemo_action)
[session_suspend.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/desktop_only_actions/session_suspend.nemo_action)

[General Actions](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/tree/master/nemo_actions/general_actions)

#### Open with admin privileges actions

These actions give you a choice of options for right click on a text based file to edit with admin privileges.

sudo_nano will open the file in a terminal text editor with admin privileges. However take care as the option will display for files you currently own and editing then will change ownership to root
sudoedit will also open the file in a terminal text editor with admin privileges. However it will  immediately close if you actually own the file.

[sudo_nano.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/general_actions/sudo_nano.nemo_action)
[sudoedit.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/general_actions/sudoedit.nemo_action)

xed_admin uses the admin:// protocol to open files with elevated privileges. Very safe but a bit clunky as you are normally asked to authenticate twice.

[xed_admin.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/general_actions/xed_admin.nemo_action)

xed_pkexec requires a polkit policy to be installed for xed in `usr/share/polkit-1/actions`

[xed_pkexec.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/general_actions/xed_pkexec.nemo_action)
[user.added.pkexec.xed.policy](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/user.added.pkexec.xed.policy)

geany_pkexec is for a alternative text editor geany (apt install geany). It also requires a polkit policy to be installed in in `usr/share/polkit-1/actions`

[geany_pkexec.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/general_actions/geany_pkexec.nemo_action)
[user.added.pkexec.geany.policy](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/user.added.pkexec.geany.policy)


#### Bulk rename actions

Both these actions open the bulk rename utility GPrename `apt install gprename`. One action is for a single folder selection to bulk rename files in that folder.
The other is for multiple selections and opens GPrename in the parent folder.

[bulk_rename_files.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/general_actions/bulk_rename_files.nemo_action)
[bulk_rename_folders.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/general_actions/bulk_rename_folders.nemo_action)

#### Creating links

An action and associated shell script to allow easy creation of symlinks to the target file/directory in a location of the users choice.
Uses zenity to ask the user to confirm a destination directory and link name.

[create_link_in_target.nemo_action](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/blob/master/nemo_actions/general_actions/create_link_in_target.nemo_action)

#### Search folders
